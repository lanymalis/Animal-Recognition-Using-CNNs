# Animal-Recognition-Using-CNNs
## Animal Recognition is a project which recognize animal images by do predicting between the input images and the model images that has been trained with Machine learning algorithms. In this project, we implement one of the most popular machine learning algorithms is Convolutional Neural Networks. Convolutional Neural Networks is an algorithms which is specialized for Image recognition and Image classification. By using CNNs, we need to do several important steps such as Image transformation, Data Loading, Building Convolutional Neural Network Model, Training the Model and Saving the best model. To implement CNNs Algorithms, we use Pytorch Machine learning Framework to access the below library in purpose to implement CNNs conveniently.
